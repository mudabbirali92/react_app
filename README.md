## Steps invloved while uploading react app on github
1) First you will create a repository without read.md (cuz it will be automatically provided by react app)
2) then you need to intall packages for react
3) npm/npx will solve this problem for us HOW?
4) you need to type a command "npx install -g creat-react-app" [It will basically create a react env at your local machine]
5) you will be needing that env at your local machine WHY? [cuz we need to do every task for testing purpose and other packges required for creating a react app]
6) What is the difference b/w YARN NPM NPX?
7) npm is the oldest version for managing all packages stuff for node, NPX is even smarter than npm especailly suitable when we are working on our local machine on the other hand YARN is the latest and the most powerful package management system. so, it will help you managing your packages while you are woking on github.
8) Now after consulting point number (3) you will need to create a project with create-react-app package.
9) you can do with the help of following command:
[create-react-app myfolder] --> remeber create-react-app wont allow you to capitalizae your project name aka the directory.
10) 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
